# Big Data Assignment 

This was a 3rd year assignment completed as part of my bachelor degree. It entailed analysing and drawing conclusions from datasets supplied to us using data science methods. The dataset contains information about nuclear power plants. Some reactors were functioning as intended whilst others were malfunctioning. Our aim was to find difference in the data which could point to malfunctioning reactors. 

To achieve this, python was used as well as libraries such as pandas (data management & visualisation) and pyspark (training, testing and predicitons). Three classifications methods were used: a decision tree, a support vector machine, and a neural network. Each method was compared to see which would be the preferred method. This was found to be the artificial neural network. However it was concluded that such methods cannot be used to adequately defect malfunctioning reactors.
